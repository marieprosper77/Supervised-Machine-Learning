Considering the Models -

After looking at the dataset and considering the two model types, I believe that the logistic regression model 
will perform better for this dataset.  Both Random Forest and Logistic Regression models are good for classification 
problems

Evaluating the Models - without scaling the data, the Random Forest model performed better on the test data.

Results w/ Scaling - Once I scaled the data, the logistic regression became the better classifier. It had an accuracy score of .66.  
The Random Forest model decreased in accuracy from .64 to .5.  

While I was able to produce a model with a .66 accuracy metric, I would be concerned about employing this out into the wild for credit 
worthiness rating purposes.
